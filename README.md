Just a quick refresh for my third go at TOP

This project is to make several webpages of recipes, with unordered lists for ingredients and ordered lists for cooking instructions.

Looking to demonstrate skills at anchoring links; displaying images; generating ordered and unordered lists; proper use of headings, paragraphs, strong, and em elements; and writing good, frequent commit messages.
